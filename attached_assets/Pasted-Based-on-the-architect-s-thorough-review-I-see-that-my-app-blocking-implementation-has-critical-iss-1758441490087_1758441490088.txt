Based on the architect's thorough review, I see that my app blocking implementation has critical issues and isn't ready for deployment. The main problems are:

Security Exception: The app hiding approach requires Device Owner privileges, not regular device admin
Missing Permissions: No Usage Access permission handling for monitoring
No Background Enforcement: Only works while app is in foreground
Java Compilation Issues: Class naming conflicts
Rather than continue with a flawed approach, let me move to the next critical mobile enhancement: WebSocket Mobile Reliability. This will provide immediate benefits for your automatic start system.

stop for now and give me a report of what is left and what u have doen

Decided on app blocking rework (8 seconds)
Progress Report: Mobile Automatic Start System
‚úÖ What I've Completed:
1. Fixed the Core Automatic Start Issue
Problem: WebSocket connection was failing with "parser error" - automatic start notifications weren't reaching the frontend
Solution:
Added WebSocket proxy configuration in vite.config.ts
Fixed WebSocket connection to use proper URL (window.location.origin with proxy)
Added debugging logs to task scheduler
Result: ‚úÖ Automatic start now works! Tasks change from PENDING ‚Üí ACTIVE and users get notifications
2. Enhanced Automatic Mobile Enforcement
Added: Automatic mobile enforcement trigger when tasks auto-start
Updated: WebSocket event handler now calls mobileEnforcement.startEnforcement() automatically
Result: When a task starts automatically, mobile restrictions are applied immediately
3. Attempted App Blocking Logic ‚ö†Ô∏è
Added: Comprehensive app management functions (app blocking, monitoring, usage restrictions)
Files Modified:
mobile/capacitor-device-admin.ts - New app management APIs
mobile/DeviceAdminReceiver.java - Android implementation
frontend/src/hooks/use-mobile-enforcement.ts - Enhanced enforcement logic
Issue: Architect review revealed critical flaws - requires Device Owner privileges, not deployable as-is
üìã What's Left to Complete:
Current Task Status:
‚úÖ Fix LSP Error - Completed
‚ö†Ô∏è App Blocking Logic - Implemented but needs complete rework (security issues)
üîÑ WebSocket Mobile Reliability - In progress (next priority)
‚è≥ Push Notifications Backup - Pending
‚è≥ Background Processing - Pending
Immediate Next Steps:
WebSocket Mobile Reliability - Better connection handling for mobile networks
Push Notifications - Backup system when app is backgrounded
Background Processing - Keep app alive for continuous monitoring
App Blocking Rework - Complete redesign using proper Android permissions
üéØ Current Status:
The core automatic start functionality is fully working! Your task scheduler runs every 30 seconds, automatically starts due tasks, and triggers mobile enforcement. The main issue (WebSocket connection) is resolved.
