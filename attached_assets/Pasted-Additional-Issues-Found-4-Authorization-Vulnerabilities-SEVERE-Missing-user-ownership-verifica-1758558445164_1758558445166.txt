Additional Issues Found:
4. Authorization Vulnerabilities (SEVERE)
Missing user ownership verification: API endpoints like /api/tasks/:id (PATCH/DELETE), /api/proof/:sessionId/* can be accessed by any authenticated user, not just the owner
Session security: The session secret has an insecure fallback value ("fallback-secret-change-in-production")
Proof submission vulnerability: Users can potentially submit proof for sessions they don't own by manipulating the sessionId parameter
5. Database Race Conditions (MODERATE)
Task scheduler race condition: Multiple scheduler instances could pick up the same pending task simultaneously
User registration race condition: Two simultaneous registrations with the same email could both pass the existence check
Missing transactions: Multi-step operations (like task creation + file upload, proof submission + session update) lack transactional safety
6. Security & Validation Issues (MODERATE to SEVERE)
CORS misconfiguration: Currently allows ALL origins (return callback(null, true)) which is insecure for production
Missing input validation: Several endpoints don't validate that sessionId belongs to the authenticated user
Firebase config exposure: Hardcoded Firebase credentials in firebase-messaging-sw.js
File upload security: PDF upload path could be vulnerable to path traversal attacks
7. Performance Issues (LOW to MODERATE)
Missing database indexes: No explicit indexes on frequently queried fields like tasks.status, tasks.userId + startAt
Inefficient queries: Some queries could benefit from compound indexes, especially for task filtering by user + status + date ranges
No query optimization: Large result sets without pagination in task retrieval
8. Configuration Management Issues (MODERATE)
Hardcoded values: Multiple hardcoded values that should be environment variables:
Firebase config in service worker
Backend URL in Vite proxy config
Package names in mobile components
Default ports and URLs throughout the application
9. Memory Management Issues (LOW)
Event listener cleanup: While mostly handled correctly, some edge cases in WebSocket reconnection could lead to memory leaks
Firebase message listeners: Proper cleanup exists but could be more robust
Summary
The most critical additional issues are:

Authorization vulnerabilities - Users can potentially access/modify data they don't own
Database race conditions - Could lead to data corruption or duplicate processing
CORS misconfiguration - Opens the application to cross-origin attacks
