Based on my analysis of your existing implementation, here are my findings:

1. Mobile Enforcement Implementation Analysis
Your Current Implementation is Well-Designed:

From the mobile/ directory, you have:

DeviceAdminReceiver.java: Handles device admin permissions for system-level control
FocusGuardService.java: Background service for continuous monitoring
Capacitor plugins: Bridge between your React app and native Android functionality
How It Should Work:

The useMobileEnforcement hook calls native Android methods through Capacitor
Device Admin permissions allow blocking app launches and showing overlay screens
Accessibility Services can monitor which apps are running and force-close unauthorized ones
The enforcement levels (SOFT/MEDIUM/HARD) map to different restriction intensities
Potential Issues I See:

Permission Flow: Users must manually enable Device Admin and Accessibility permissions - this is a complex onboarding flow
App Killing: Android's battery optimization might kill your background service
Overlay Restrictions: Modern Android versions restrict overlay permissions heavily
Root/Knox Detection: Some enterprise devices might block these permissions entirely
2. PDF and File Uploading for Mobile
Current Issues:

Your current implementation opens PDFs in browser windows (pdfWindow.location.href = startedTask.pdfFileUrl)
File uploads use standard web File objects which work differently on mobile
Mobile-Optimized Approach:

PDF Viewing: Use Capacitor's Filesystem API to download PDFs locally, then open with native PDF viewer or in-app viewer
File Uploads: Replace web file inputs with Capacitor Camera/Filesystem APIs for better mobile UX
Storage Strategy: Cache PDFs locally so they work offline during enforcement sessions
Permissions: Handle mobile storage permissions (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
Implementation Plan:

Use @capacitor/filesystem for file operations
Use @capacitor/camera for document scanning
Implement progressive download with retry logic
Add file compression for mobile data savings
3. Network Stability Solutions
Your Current Vulnerabilities:

Real-time WebSocket connections fail on mobile network switches
Task enforcement depends on constant backend communication
File uploads can fail on slow/unstable connections
Recommended Solutions:

Offline-First Architecture:

Cache essential data locally using Capacitor Storage
Queue API requests when offline, sync when reconnected
Store enforcement sessions locally with periodic sync
Network Resilience:

Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
Use service workers for background sync
Add network status detection with @capacitor/network
Implement request deduplication and retry logic
Smart Enforcement:

Download task data and PDFs before enforcement starts
Continue enforcement even if backend is unreachable
Sync proof submissions when connection returns
Use local timers as backup for enforcement duration
Progressive Enhancement:

Core enforcement works offline
Real-time features enhance experience when online
Graceful degradation for poor connectivity
The key insight is making enforcement locally autonomous - the mobile app should be able to enforce focus sessions even without internet, then sync results when connectivity improves.
